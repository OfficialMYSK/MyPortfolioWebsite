            <h2>My Design Philosophy</h2>
            <p>I'm a designer who believes in the emotional power of visuals. My work focuses on creating story-driven experiences that resonate deeply and leave a lasting impression.</p>
            <p>With a mind that thinks in images, I specialize in translating abstract concepts into meaningful visuals. I bring precision and emotional depth to every project, whether I'm working in Photoshop, Figma, or exploring new media to better express an idea.</p>

          <div class="about-section">
            <h2>My Journey</h2>
            <p>I got into design because I've always been fascinated by how visuals and stories can move people emotionally. For me, design isn't just about how something looks—it's about what it makes you feel.</p>
            <p>My process often begins with a flood of ideas—my mind fires up visually, so sketching helps me catch those abstract thoughts before they drift away. From there, I explore different media to express the concept better, then refine it through feedback and detail-oriented execution.</p>
          </div>

          <div class="about-section">
            <h2>What Drives Me</h2>
            <p>I'm drawn to projects that combine storytelling with design—where every element serves a purpose and creates genuine emotional connections. I want my work to make people feel something real, not just glance at it and move on.</p>
            <p>When I'm not designing, I recharge through sports like football and wakeboarding, finding that same balance of creativity and precision in physical movement.</p>
            <p class="about-closing">My goal is simple:<br>"To create work that makes people feel something real, and remember it."</p>
